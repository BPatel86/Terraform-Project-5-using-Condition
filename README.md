# Terraform-Project-5-using-Condition

This Terraform project demonstrates how to create EC2 instances in AWS based on conditions using Terraform's `count` and conditional expressions.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Creates **two EC2 instances** conditionally using `count` and logical expressions.
- Helps manage infrastructure deployment dynamically based on variable values.

## ðŸ§± Key Concepts Used

- **`count` with conditions**: Used to control the number of resources created.
- **Conditional expressions**: Terraform logic to determine resource creation based on input variables.
